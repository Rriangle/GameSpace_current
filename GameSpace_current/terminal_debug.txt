Terminal Debug Information
========================

Error: [internal] Failed to call client side v2 tool: [internal] internal error

This indicates the terminal tool is experiencing internal errors and cannot execute commands.

Attempted commands:
- cd /workspace && pwd && whoami
- echo "測試終端連線"

Both failed with the same internal error.

Possible solutions:
1. Tool restart may be needed
2. System resource limitations
3. Network connectivity issues
4. Process/session timeout

Current capabilities still available:
- File read/write operations
- Directory listing
- File search/grep
- File editing operations

Recommended workaround:
- Use file operations to create scripts
- Provide manual execution instructions
- Document commands for user execution
