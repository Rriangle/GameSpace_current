# GameSpace WIP Run Log

## Done
- Initial project structure analysis
- Read CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.txt requirements
- Read old_0905.txt and new_0905.txt specifications
- Identified missing documentation structure
- Created docs/WIP_RUN.md and docs/PROGRESS.json
- Fixed language violations in C# code (HomeController.cs, Program.cs, GameSpacedatabaseContext.cs)
- Created health check endpoints (/api/health, /api/health/db)
- Created basic README.md with setup instructions
- Created FakeDataService for MiniGame area (200 rows per table)
- Created AdminController for fake data generation endpoint

## Next
- Continue fixing remaining Chinese text in Views and other files
- Implement Stage 1 (Data Mapping) - read models and repositories
- Create proper Area layouts for MiniGame
- Implement basic CRUD operations for MiniGame modules
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Create unit tests for core functionality

## Risks
- Database schema file is too large to read in one go
- Need to verify compliance with CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.txt requirements
- Multiple Areas need to be implemented (not just MiniGame)

## Assumptions
- Project follows ASP.NET Core MVC structure
- Database schema is in database.sql
- Need to implement full project scope, not just MiniGame area

## Files Touched
- docs/WIP_RUN.md (created)

## Next-Run Delta Plan
1. Create PROGRESS.json with initial stage 0
2. Audit existing code for English language compliance
3. Check database schema alignment
4. Begin Stage 0 implementation (skeleton & CI)
