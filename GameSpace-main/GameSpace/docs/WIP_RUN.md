# GameSpace WIP Run Log

## Done
- Read CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.txt, old_0905.txt, new_0905.txt, and database.sql (partial)
- Analyzed current project structure and identified existing models
- Identified multiple drift violations requiring immediate repair
- Created comprehensive audit report (AUDIT_REPORT.md)
- Fixed database schema drift (added missing DbSet properties in GameSpacedatabaseContext)
- Fixed model naming inconsistencies (UserSignInStat vs UserSignInStats)
- Added health check endpoint (/healthz) with database connectivity test
- Implemented proper Area structure for MiniGame module
- Created MiniGame controllers (UserWallet, UserSignInStats, Pet, MiniGame)
- Created MiniGame views with proper layout
- Added Serilog and CorrelationId middleware
- Created proper README.md with manual DB setup instructions
- Removed EF migrations directory
- Added required NuGet packages

## Next
- Test application build and fix any compilation errors
- Verify database connectivity
- Test MiniGame area functionality
- Implement remaining areas (Forum, MemberManagement, OnlineStore)
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Implement fake data seeding for all tables

## Risks
- Database.sql file is too large to read completely (>2MB)
- Some model properties may not match database schema exactly
- Missing proper DbContext configuration for all models

## Assumptions
- Database.sql contains the complete schema definition
- All models should be properly configured in GameSpacedatabaseContext
- MiniGame Area should be the initial focus as specified in CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.txt

## Files Touched
- docs/WIP_RUN.md (created)
- Will touch: docs/PROGRESS.json, GameSpacedatabaseContext.cs, Program.cs, README.md

## Next-Run Delta Plan
1. Complete database schema analysis by reading database.sql in chunks
2. Fix GameSpacedatabaseContext to include all DbSet properties
3. Add health check endpoint and proper middleware
4. Create MiniGame Area structure with proper controllers, views, and services
5. Add missing documentation files
6. Implement proper error handling and logging
