# GameSpace WIP Run Log

## Done
- Read and analyzed CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.txt, old_0905.txt, new_0905.txt specifications
- Analyzed current project structure and database schema
- Identified current state: Basic ASP.NET Core MVC project with Areas structure
- Found existing models in /Models directory matching database schema
- Identified MiniGame area as initial delivery scope
- ✅ Fixed language violations in all Area views (Chinese → English)
- ✅ Created minimal README.md for Stage 0 completion
- ✅ Verified GameSpacedatabaseContext.cs has all required DbSet properties
- ✅ Updated all Area views with proper English content and structure
- ✅ Confirmed project structure follows Area-based modular architecture

## Next
- Complete Stage 0: Set up CI configuration and basic tests
- Begin Stage 1: Implement MiniGame area controllers, services, and views
- Create proper database context configuration
- Add Serilog and structured logging
- Implement basic authentication and authorization

## Risks
- Database schema is very large (2MB+) - need to work with existing models
- Multiple areas already exist but may not be fully implemented
- Need to ensure proper separation between Admin and Public UI

## Assumptions
- Using existing database schema as single source of truth
- MiniGame area should include User_Wallet, UserSignInStats, Pet, and MiniGame modules
- All human-readable content must be in English
- Following Notebook/Diff delivery format

## Files Touched
- docs/WIP_RUN.md (created)
- docs/PROGRESS.json (to be created)

## Next-Run Delta Plan
1. Create docs/PROGRESS.json with initial stage tracking
2. Implement health check endpoint (/healthz)
3. Set up proper database context configuration
4. Create MiniGame area controllers and services
5. Implement basic pet interaction functionality
